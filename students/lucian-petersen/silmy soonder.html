  <h1>"Lotion, I mean Lucan, I mean LUCIAN"</h1>

  <p>I, Lucian—the beast slayer of bugs behind my couch and overthinker—have gone to the place where you do that learning thing :D</p>

  <p>Have you ever had chili? It's soooo good. Best food easily. I love my mom's chili. Mmmhhhh mmmhhhh mmmhhh mmmmmmhhh.</p>

  <p>Do you like video games? Yo, me too (unless you said no). I’ve always had a fondness for indie games, but I don’t consider it a genre. Cuphead’s pretty fun, same with Shovel Knight, Hollow Knight, and Deltarune (yeah I like Deltarune—what, you gonna sue me or something?). Oh yeah, I also just got Silksong. It’s really good :D</p>
